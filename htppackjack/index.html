	Rules for Packjack in Real Life<br><br>
	You do not need to split half your cards if there are only 2 players. <br>
	The number of cards per person depend on how many people there are. If there are 3, than 8 cards each. 2 players, 12 cards each.

	Packjack is a gambling game that has no money involved (it could have money) and that its name came from nowhere. Here is how to play. <br>

	You should have: <br><br>
	At least 2 players <br>
	8 cards for each player <br>
	An apparatus that can tell you a random number between 1 and 10 <br>

	Each player gets 8 cards. <br><br>
	All of the players bid an amount of cards and put it into the pile at the center. <br>
	You can bid more even after you have already bidded if you want. <br>
	Make the apparatus tell you a random number between 1 and 10. <br>

	If… <br><br>
	The random number is higher than 3, then the person who bidded the most gets the pile. The other people have to split their card amount in half and give that half to the person(s) who won if they bet less than half of their cards.<br>

	The random number is 3 or lower, then the pile will be given to the person that didn’t bet the most. If there are more than two people though, then they will split it evenly. If the person who lost bet less than half their cards, their cards will be split in half and transferred equally to everyone.<br>

	Special Occasions: <br><br>
	Two or more people bid the same amount of cards and that amount is the highest. If the random number is higher than 5, then the pile will split evenly to them. If the random number is 5 or lower, then the pile will be split evenly to the people that didn’t bet the most. The two or more people that bet the same and got the highest amount will have to split both of theirs and give it to the person(s) who won. <br>

	Two or more people bid the same amount of cards and that amount is the lowest. The rules on top are applied but it is the opposite. <br>

	You can win if all the other players have no cards left. <br><br>

	Also, the person who betted more than the others has a better chance of winning.
