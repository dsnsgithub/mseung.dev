                <h2>About Nuclei</h2>
                My goal in creating Nuclei was to inspire and educate young
                minds about the fascinating world of computer science. As
                technology continues to advance, with developments like AI and
                Autonomous Driving, it is crucial for this generation to be
                equipped with the necessary skills to seamlessly integrate into
                the dynamic realities that await them. Even if they do not
                choose to pursue it as a career, I believe understanding the
                fundamental building blocks of computer science is a core in
                unlocking the hidden secrets that drive the many facets of this
                world, just like nuclei are to the core of atoms. With Nuclei, I
                hope to empower young people to explore and embrace this
                exciting field.

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                If you didnâ€™t know already, my name is Atharv. Iâ€™m 13 years old
                as of 2023 and am a passionate coder with experience in Python,
                Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and more! I have nearly 5 years of
                experience and have worked with data structures, algorithms,
                web/app development, OOP, procedural programming, and more!. I
                also have experience in developing and testing AI, and like to
                tackle algorithmic based problems and participate in the USACO
                program. I have taken multiple college-level courses such as
                CS-50 and Georgia Tech on edX. When Iâ€™m not engrossed in
                programming, Iâ€™m participating in the academic beeâ€™s and bowls
                in Science, History, and Geography, going in math
                programs/competitions, and learning physics. Other than
                academics, you can find me reading, playing sports, or in a game
                of chess(I could go on, but it would get lengthy) . I love to
                teach people about my passion and watching them grow and explore
                more topics in the seemingly endless realm of computer science.
                As a kid myself, I can better connect with you/your child and
                use unique, beneficial teaching styles catered to each student.

                <h2>CURRICULUM</h2>
                Currently, I offer 3 courses in Python(Java coming soon!). Which
                is divided into three separate sections to provide more
                convenience in shifting students into the appropriate section.
                Python 1(Graphics Superstar) This course utilizes python turtle,
                an art extension of python itself, to teach students about the
                fundamentals of python such as event listeners, loops, nested
                loops, functions, input/output statements, and many more
                beginner python techniques. Students will create various
                projects that will begin with basic art but advance into games
                built upon the art they are making. This course features a
                master project at the end where the student can make anything
                they want that uses all the skills theyâ€™ve learned! Python
                2(Problem Solver) As students move forward to more advanced
                concepts, this course begins by going in depth into concepts
                that were previously learnt and applying them to practical
                problems. The course will go over a review section, ASCII and
                cyphers, Conditionals, Function Parameters, Data structures, and
                several complex games utilizing several concepts such as black
                jack, a card shuffler, etc. This is followed by a master project
                where they can make any tool/game they want that uses skills
                theyâ€™ve learned! Python 3(Algorithms Master) At this final
                section of the Python courses, students will begin to learn and
                apply advanced concepts, but begins with a review once again of
                everything they learned previously, as the projects in this
                course will require fluent use of them. Right after, they dive
                into several exciting topics such as Recursion, Introduction to
                Algorithms, Runtime Analysis, and a more in depth study of
                algorithms by coding all the sorting algorithms, learning how
                they work, comparing their efficiency, and finally applying them
                to real world problems. At the end, students will code Conwayâ€™s
                game of Life, and a Tic Tac Toe AI. These skills are widely used
                in FAANG and are the core of a software engineerâ€™s array of
                skills! These courses will have customization options for you to
                decide the speed, depth, and homework load. Additionally, each
                section has at least three check-ins to test the student and
                make sure they understand the concepts they have just learned,
                which can help me understand their proficiency and if I need to
                slow down or speed up on upcoming topics. An example would
                include recursion, one of the most difficult concepts to grasp,
                which is why I devoted a whole 2 units to it as well as a
                check-in right after to make sure the student fully understands
                it. The customization options are there so I can suit your
                learning needs to the best of my abilities.
